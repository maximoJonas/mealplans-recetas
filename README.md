# mealplans-recetas
take your meal plan for all the week with your preferences

The user enters what diet they want to follow, such as paleo, vegan, vegetarian or no diet and then the days they want to do the diet of the week, as well as the kcal they want to consume per day. With all this data and the information that I get from the api I manage to give you 3 daily recipes for the whole week. These recipes are divided into ingredients to make a shopping list so that you can buy everything you need at the nearest supermarket.

I think it is an application that all supermarkets are going to use tomorrow to be able to buy recipes directly and that the purchase is added to the shopping cart for greater speed and ease for the user.

It is also uploaded with streamlit for a more pleasant visualization.

Disadvantage: The api that I used is paid and if many queries are made they charge me, so the api key is disabledThe user enters what diet they want to follow, such as paleo, vegan, vegetarian or no diet and then the days they want to do the diet of the week, as well as the kcal they want to consume per day.
